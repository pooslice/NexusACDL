# NexusACDL
Nexus Auto Click Downloader

Made for people with free Nexusmod account that shouldnt have to click 4000 (or more really...) times to download a mod collection.

I made it for personal use since the ones I found didn't work at all, or lacked multi monitor support.


This can actually be configured to click on anything you want probably since it uses png images to decide what to click on.

The .png files can be found in the "res" folder. If they don't work for you, because of an update or change in the future, you can screen capture what you want it to click on yourself.


It has multiple monitor support so you have to select wich monitor it will check and click on.


Made in C#, and requires .net 8.0 runtime.
